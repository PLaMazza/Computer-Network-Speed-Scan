# Computer-Network-Speed-Scan
This will find the network speed of the computer and dump it into a file

This is not that complicated but I found this to be pretty useful. This script can help you sniff out which computers are not at the expected ethernet connection speed. 
A use case example would be you want to validate all computers have a connection speed of 1gig. This script validates the computer is actually getting 1 gig and not just that the switch has full duplex. 

In the script you can set a file you want it to write to, in most cases you would have it write to a network file not to the local machine.
